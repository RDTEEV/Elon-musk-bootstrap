        <p>Elon Reeve Musk born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO and chief
            engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner and CEO of Twitter,
            Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the philanthropic
            Musk Foundation. With an estimated net worth of around $164 billion as of December 13, 2022, primarily from
            his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is the second-wealthiest person in the world according to
            both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time billionaires list.

            Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa and briefly attended at the University of Pretoria before moving to
            Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated
            at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's
            degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. After two
            days, he dropped out and with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. In
            1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq for $307 million and Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged
            with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002.

            With $175.8 million, Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he was an early
            investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman
            and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar
            energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a
            nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, he co-founded Neuralink—a
            neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction
            company. Musk has also proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2022, his
            acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion was completed.

            Musk has made controversial statements on politics and technology, particularly on Twitter, and is a
            polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including
            spreading COVID-19 misinformation. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for
            falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. Musk stepped down as chairman
            of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine as part of a settlement agreement with the SEC.</p>
